# Installation

Make sure you have dependencies installed, as described [here](https://github.com/Navigation-Games/EasyGecNG/blob/main/README.md#normal-installation-instructions). Download the `.zip` here. Unzip it, and double click `bin/EasyGecNG` to run.

Once the app is running, remember to import a course file, and switch the app to "Smiley face" mode. Happy orienteering!
