# teach-o

Teach-O is a modified version of EasyGec for Navigation Games, a Boston-based non-profit focused on introducing the sport of orienteering to new audiences, especially P.E. programs in schools.
EasyGec is a program developed by Thierry Porret, and he has kindly given us permission to use his source code and modify it for our own purposes.
